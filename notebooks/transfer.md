## Transfer files from a FABRIC host

In future experiments, we'll often want to save the results of an experiment to a file on a FABRIC host, then transfer it to our own laptop for further inspection and analysis. In this exercise, we will learn how to do that!

As described above, open an SSH session to the "romeo" host in your topology. On this host, run the following command:

```
ping -c 10 10.0.1.2 | tee ping.txt
```

This will:

* send a sequence of "ICMP echo" messages to the "juliet" host, which will trigger a response from "juliet"
* save the results - which includes the round trip delay from the time when the request is sent from "romeo", to the time that the response from "juliet" is received - to a file `ping.txt`. (The results will also be displayed in the terminal output.)

Now, in this notebook, run

:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
slice.get_node("romeo").download_file("/home/fabric/work/ping.txt", "/home/ubuntu/ping.txt")
```

In the Jupyter environment, click on the folder icon in the file browser on the left to make sure that you are located in your "Jupyter home" directory.

Then, you should see the `ping.txt` file appear in the Jupyter file browser on the left. You can now download this file from the Jupyter environment to your own laptop.
